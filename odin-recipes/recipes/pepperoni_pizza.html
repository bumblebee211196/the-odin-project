    <h3 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients text">
      <li>1/2 (12 ounce) can CONTADINA® Tomato Paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="procedure">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="procedure text">
      <li>
        For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop
        while making crust. Freeze remaining paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well
        blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is
        formed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed.
        (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.).
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit
        pans.
      </li>
      <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
      <li>
        Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans
        between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.
      </li>
